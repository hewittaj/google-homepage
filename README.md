This is a project based on The Odin Project curriculum that will help build and utilize some of the following skills.
In this I will attempt to recreate the google homepage, on a more basic level.

Observable skills used:
1. Two ways to move a div around on the page
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
5. Center an element horizontally
6. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)

Reflection on what I created: 
1. I learned how to create a basic html file, that roughly looked like the google homepage.
2. I learned how to search for best practices and examples to get my code to work.
3. Figured out what CSS styles would apply to some html code and what wouldn't.
